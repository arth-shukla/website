My current research interests lie in embodied AI and robot learning, with some intersections with RL, CV, etc. Broadly, I am to develop agents which learn to solve useful robotics tasks with minimal human supervision. To this end, my research revolves around reinforcement learning, simulation, learning from demonstrations, and scalable datasets/benchmarks."
